all parameters to ESLint plugin options\\n\\nNow, the ESLint plugin accepts all parameters.\\n\\nIt is useful for detailed behavior of the checker.\\nFor instance, when the system is busy, the fuzz checker reports a false positive by its timeout (See [#447](https://github.com/makenowjust-labs/recheck/issues/447), thanks [@falsandtru](https://github.com/falsandtru)).\\nWe can prevent this by specifying `attackTimeout` to `null` (disabling timeout on the attack phase).\\n\\n# Fixes\\n\\n## Fix zero-width assertion in automaton checker\\n\\nIn the past, next character kinds are omitted after refining a transition, so it equates two states which should be distinguish.\\nThis fix makes it to include next character kind in state.\\n\\nNow, we can check `/^.+?aa[^@]@/` correctly.\\n\\n## Correct to increase steps on back-reference\\n\\nIn the past, since the back-reference increases step at one, the checker may estimate a lower complexity than actual.\\nThe step should be increased by the length of the read string, and has been corrected as such.\\n\\nNow, we can check `/^(.+)\\\\1$/` correctly.\\n\\n# P.S.\\n\\nWe apologize you to delay for release the next major version.\\nI have a few time to develop recheck recently, but we are preparing [a big patch for the next major version](https://github.com/makenowjust-labs/recheck/pull/378).\\nPlease look

the new release of recheck v4.3.0.\\n\\nIt is a small release to go forward to a milestone.\\nHowever, it has some important changes and improvements.\\nWe will describe them.\\n\\nYou could see [the complete CHANGELOG](https://github.com/makenowjust-labs/recheck/releases/tag/v4.3.0) for detailed informations.\\n\\n# New Features\\n\\n## `worker` backend for NPM package\\n\\nThe `recheck` NPM package now contains `worker` backend.\\nIt is pure JavaScript (Scala.js build) backend with [`worker_threads`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) (for Node.js) or [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) (for browsers).\\nIn other words, you can use `recheck` in asynchronous on JavaScript without any external commands depending on the settings.\\nThis should allow `recheck` to be used in many more environments.\\n\\nYou can use `worker` backend explicitly by the following way:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ RECHECK_BACKEND=worker node\\n> await require(\'recheck\').check(\'^(a|a)*$\', \'\')\\n```\\n\\nEspecially, it is very comfortable to use in a browser.\\nThe code to run on workers is bundled inline, so no additional configuration is required to use.\\n\\nHowever, Scala.js build is bundled twice for usual environment and workers.\\nAs a result, a file size after building may be larger than before.\\nIn order to avoid this, we consider it is effective to use conditional exports and provide a build of the ES module version that allows tree shaking.\\nThis will be addressed in the next version.\\n\\n# Changes\\n\\n## Rename `hybrid` to `auto`\\n\\nInitially, we thought the name `hybrid` would be appropriate, since it uses both fuzzing and automata theory based algorithms.\\nHowever, this name may have given a wrong impression, because the implementation actually automatically decides which algorithm is better.\\n\\nTo deal with this problem, we renamed `hybrid` to `auto`.\\n\\n## Rename `labo` to `labs`\\n\\n`MakeNowJust-Labo` is renamed to `makenowjust-labs` now, and `codes.quine.labo` namespace is also renamed to `codes.quine.labs`.\\nPlease update dependencies and link names.\\n\\n```diff\\n-libraryDependencies += \\"codes.quine.labo\\" %% \\"recheck-core\\" % \\"4.2.2\\"\\n+libraryDependencies += \\"codes.quine.labs\\" %% \\"recheck-core\\" % \\"4.3.0\\"\\n```\\n\\n# Miscellaneous\\n\\n## Website renewal\\n\\nThe website has been completely renewed using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).\\nThanks Docusaurus team for providing such a good documentation tool.\\n\\nThe new website has detailed usages as a library and ESLint plugin, and a playground where all options can now be specified.\\nIt will be much more convenient than before.\\n\\n# P.S.\\n\\nWe continue to develop the project to release `recheck` v5.\\nSome of the features planned for v5 and more futures are as follows:\\n\\n- A new parser to parse other dialect than JavaScript\\n- To support to analysis other language\'s regex\\n- To suggest a new regex to prevent ReDoS (auto repairing)\\n\\nThank you for your interesting!"}]}')}}]);
